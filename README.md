## Quick Start Guide

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system. This project depends on several Python libraries, including `requests`, `beautifulsoup4`, `wordcloud`, `matplotlib`, `python-docx`, and `openai`. You can install these using pip:

  ```bash
  pip install requests beautifulsoup4 wordcloud matplotlib python-docx openai
  ```

### Installation
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Op27/NewsAutoAnalysisUKR.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd NewsAutoAnalysisUKR
    ```

3. Install the required Python packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    Note: This command ensures that all the necessary Python packages are installed and up to date. If you have previously installed the required packages, this command will verify your installation, making it a safe operation to perform.


### Usage
To run the tool, execute the main script from the command line:
  ```bash
  python main.py
  ```

### Obtaining OpenAI API Key
For summarization features in NewsAutoAnalysisUKR, an API key from OpenAI is required. This key enables interaction with OpenAI's GPT models to generate summaries. To obtain an API key, users must create an account on the [OpenAI platform](https://openai.com/) and follow the instructions to register for API access. Please be aware that OpenAI's services might incur costs depending on the usage volume, so it's advisable to review their pricing structure. After obtaining your API key, ensure to secure it properly and not to share it publicly or with unauthorized users.

## Customization
### Configuring the prompt.txt for OpenAI
NewsAutoAnalysisUKR utilizes OpenAI's GPT models for generating summaries of the scraped news articles. The tool sends a customizable prompt to the GPT model, which is defined in the prompt.txt file. Users can modify this file to tailor the analysis and summaries generated by the tool according to their specific requirements or interests.

#### Editing prompt.txt
1. Locate the prompt.txt file in the root directory of the project.
2. Open the file in a text editor of your choice.
3. Edit the prompt according to your needs. The content of this file will be used as the basis for the GPT model's text generation, so consider what instructions or context you want to provide to achieve the desired output.
4. Save your changes to the file before running the analysis.

This flexibility allows users to direct the focus of the summaries, making the tool versatile across a range of use cases. Whether you're interested in highlighting certain aspects of the news articles or analyzing from a specific perspective, customizing the prompt.txt file enables personalized analysis outputs.


## How It Works
**Scraping**: The tool first scrapes news articles from pre-defined URLs.  
**Analysis**: Analyzes the text to generate visualizations and identify key themes.  
**Summarization**: Summarizes the content using GPT, producing a coherent overview of the main points.
